Instruction

1. Name: as question{x}.ipynb, no space and other words!
2. mergefile.sh is for merge file, run it before start!
4. For all the questions, run the question1_new.ipnyb first to get the preprocessed.txt
	The format for preprocessed.txt is as following:
	"actor/actress Id\t\tmovieName1\t\tmovieName2....."
3. For questions after Question 6, if movie graph is needed, run question6_py.ipynb first to generate the edgelist file or ask me(Tang) for the download link. (The edgelist file is about 1.5G, taking about half an hour to generate)


Prompt for generating the graph
---
When generating the graph for movies or actors, remember to use the data structure smartly...
(At first, I used the intersection and union function, it takes me more than 12+ hours to generate the only half of the graph...)T.T
